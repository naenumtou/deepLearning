This repository contained the process of LIME Explanation. Begin with generating images dataset, which are including films X-Ray of COVID-19 cases and normal cases. Followed by the training model processes, which are including create new CNN Model and transfer-learning with pre-trained model. At last, using LIME Explainer to see inside the model black-box.

## Model materials
* `XRayImageGen.ipynb`: The dataset generator using films X-Ray of COVID-19 cases and normal cases. The image processing is to fit with Xception pre-trained model from Keras.
* `COVIDXRayTrainingModel.ipynb`: The model classification training process. There are two trained models, which are simple CNN Model and transfer-learning with Xception.
* `LIMEImageExplainer.ipynb`: The model explanation using LIME. It looks inside the black-box of models and create interpretability concept of classifier. 

## Sample LIME Explainer results
