The learning TensorFlow repository is contained the Google Colab notebooks that have been using TensorFlow to develop the model. This is covered various areas such as Computer Vision (Object detection, Recognition), Natural language processing (NLP), etc.

## Object classification
* `X_rayCOVIDClassification.ipynb`: Using CNN Model to classify COVID-19 film X-Ray out ot normal cases.

## Object recognition
* `OCRModel.ipynb`: Developed the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Model to recognise image handwriting.
* `autoencoder_face.ipynb`: Using Auto-Encoder to reconstruct face images.

## Financial model
* `autoencoders_fraud_detection.ipynb`: Using Auto-Encoder to detect fraud in the credit card dataset.

## Natural language processing (NLP)
* `word2vec.ipynb`: Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify news topics.

## Others
* `colabTPU.ipynb`: The experiment to use TPU for model training.
* `linearRegression.ipynb`: Building linear regression model in TensorFlow.
