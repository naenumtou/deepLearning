This repository contained Leica detection model. The 'Leica' is the my super Siberian Husky dog, so training him the model. Basically, the model is devloped by YOLO V3 pre-trained model with a helpful library `imageai`, it is much more convenient. Then, the trained model is leveraged to detect my Leica from the images.

## Model materials
* `LeicaDetection.ipynb`: The Google Colab notebook to train custom object detection model with YOLO V3 pre-trained model.
* `LeicaPrediction.ipynb`: The Google Colab notebook to detect my Leica in the images.
